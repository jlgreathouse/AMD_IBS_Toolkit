Gathering IBS Samples Using the Linux(r) perf_events System
===============================================================================

This document describes the steps needed to collect Instruction Based Sampling
(IBS) traces from AMD processors using the Linux(r) perf_events (a.k.a. 'perf')
system and associated utilities. This document is included as part of AMD
Research's IBS Toolkit; while the AMD Research IBS Toolkit contains its own
driver that allows access to IBS samples, it is an unofficial mechanism that
will not be mainlined.

Official support for performance monitoring mechanisms like AMD IBS is offered
as part of the Linux kernel's 'perf' infrastructure (frequently referred to as
perf_events to make it easier to find with an internet search). IBS support
was added in the Linux 3.2 timeframe. Because perf is an official part of the
Linux kernel, any tools built to use IBS should strive to use it if they
plan on being widely distributed.

That said, the AMD Research IBS Toolkit is available for a number of research-
related IBS development purposes:
  * The AMD Research IBS Toolkit driver works on Linux kernels before v3.2,
    when IBS support was officially added to perf_events. The earliest kernel
    tested is a later CentOS version of 2.6.18 (2.6.18-419, specifically).
  * Because the AMD Research IBS Toolkit driver is a module, it is easier
    to make custom modifications (such as only gathering some IBS values
    in the kernel to reduce overheads). In addition, it can be updated more
    rapidly to enable IBS on new processors without upgrading the rest of
    the kernel.
  * The interface to the AMD Research IBS Toolkit driver may be somewhat
    easier to navigate than the perf_events interface (though this file
    is an attempt to ameliorate these difficulties). Thus this toolkit may
    be useful for researchers who want to use IBS without becoming experts
    on perf_events.

That said, there are major benefits to using perf_events that should not be
discounted:
  * It is the official Linux mechanism for accessing IBS data. This point
    should not be understated -- because perf_events is the Linux kernel's
    mechanism for getting to IBS, drivers like those available in the
    AMD Research IBS Toolkit will not be mainlined. As such, any software
    you ship that uses IBS would likely want to use the perf_events
    infrastructure rather than shipping this driver with your tool.
  * Because perf_events is the official mechanism to access IBS in Linux,
    AMD offers no claim of support or warranty for the AMD Research IBS
    Toolkit. This toolkit is offered as a snapshot of things that researchers
    in one organization of AMD have found useful; it may or may not be
    updated as IBS mechanisms change, new processors are added, bugs are
    found, or Linux kernel APIs change.
  * The perf_events subsystem has all of the capabilities of the AMD
    Research IBS Toolkit driver and more. Later in this document, we will
    include a translation table from our driver's ioctl() commands to the
    commands to do these things in perf_events. In addition, perf_events
    has added capabilities, like time-multiplexing IBS samples between
    separate processes (while this toolkit's IBS samples can only be
    gathered system wide and must be post-processed to remove samples from
    other processes).
  * Using the perf_events subsystem to gather IBS traces also allows you to
    take advantage of perf_events's user-land tools (such as 'perf'). These
    can be used to map IBS samples onto processes, graph data about samples,
    and many other useful performance-monitoring tasks. We have replicated
    some of this functionality in the AMD Research IBS Toolkit, but we do
    not have any plans to reach parity with this tooling (the goal with
    our toolkit was, instead, to make prototyping new tooling in a research
    setting somewhat easier).

With these points in mind, our view of the AMD Research IBS Toolkit is as a
research and prototyping platform. You can use it to bring up new hardware,
try out new IBS sampling mechanisms, gather IBS samples for research
projects, and quickly build new IBS-using tools. This document exists as a
sort of Rosetta Stone for taking those tools and translating them to work
on top of the official perf_events mechanisms once you want to release
the tool for general use.

This document is thus split into 6 parts:
  1. A quick introduction to using Linux perf_events to obtain IBS samples
  2. Directions for opening the perf_event file descriptor for IBS samples
  3. How to map the kernel ring buffer in user land to obtain IBS samples
  4. How to start IBS sample collection in perf_events
  5. Collecting IBS samples out of the perf_events system
  6. A map of AMD Research IBS Toolkit commands to their perf_event mirrors


An introduction to obtaining IBS samples with the Linux(r) perf_events system
===============================================================================
The Linux(r) perf_events system (officially 'perf') is the name for both the
kernel-level and user-level tools to gather hardware performance monitoring
information in Linux. For general information about this system, please see
the following websites:
  * http://web.eece.maine.edu/~vweaver/projects/perf_events/
  * http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html
  * https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page

In addition, a great deal of information about how to interface with the
kernel perf infrastructure can be found in the manpage for perf_event_open.
See, for example: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html

The perf_events system can be used for a wide range of performance monitoring
hardware, from generic performance counters to more advanced vendor-specific
hardware. AMD's IBS support is one part of this, and this document only
covers the information necessary to gather this data.

At high level, there are six steps needed to gather IBS data from perf_events:
  1. A file descriptor for an IBS event must be opened using perf_event_open()
     system call with proper attributes.
  2. Raw IBS samples are collected by the kernel in a kernel ring buffer.
     Therefore, the user must mmap that ring buffer to user-land by calling
     the mmap() system on the file descriptor for the IBS event.
  3. The event must then be enabled to start collecting the samples. For
     example, this could be done just before starting the execution of the
     program which is to be monitored.
     When IBS monitoring is on the samples are collected in the kernel ring
     buffer by the Linux kernel.
  4. Samples collected in the kernel ring buffer must be read to user space
     for post-processing and/or parsing. This reading of the ring buffer can
     also take place while more values are being added to the buffer.
  5. Parsing the IBS samples.
  6. Finally, when monitoring is finished, the event (IBS sampling) must be
     disabled.

The Linux perf_events system comes with several user-land utility functions
that help users interact with perf's interface. While it is not strictly
necessary to use them, they can be helpful in reducing the amount of effort
needed to collect raw IBS samples.

The following sections describe more details of these four steps of gathering
IBS data from the perf_events system.


Directions for opening the perf_event file descriptor for IBS samples
===============================================================================
The Linux(r) perf_events subsystem exposes a narrow interface to user land for
performance monitoring. Specifically, any event that is to be monitored must
open a file descriptor with perf_event_open() system call. The manpage for
perf_event_open() contains a great deal of information about this interface,
but this and the following sections primarily discuss how to use this interface
to get IBS samples.

The contents of the perf_event_attr structure passed as a parameter to the
perf_event_open() system call determines which event should be monitored.
The code snippet at the bottom of this section shows example content of various
fields of this structure to enable IBS. Since IBS samples can be collected for
micro-ops or for fetch samples (see this tool's README.txt for more
information), there are two separate code snippets. The first shows example
attribute values for IBS micro-op sampling, while the second shows the
attribute values for IBS fetch sampling. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code snippet 1: perf_event_attr fields required for IBS op sampling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Type comes from /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_op/type
type = 8;
// Setting this bit in config enables sampling every sample_period ops.
// Leaving it unset will take an IBS sample every sample_period cycles
config = ((1ULL<<19);
sample_period = 0x10; // Can be any value > 0x10
sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_RAW | PERF_SAMPLE_CPU;
disabled = 1;
inherit = 1;
execlude_kernel = 0;
exclude_user = 0;
exclude_hv = 0;
exclude_guest = 0;
exclude_idle = 0;
exclude_host = 0;
pinned = 0;
pecise_ip = 1;
mmap = 1;
comm = 1;
task = 1;
sample_id_all = 1;
comm_exec = 1;
read_format = 0;
mmap_pages= 256; //This can be changed – user settable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code snippet 2: perf_event_attr fields required for IBS fetch sampling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
//Type from /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_fetch/type
type = 9;
// Set bit 57 to cause the low order bits of the sample period to randomize
config = ((1ULL<<57);
// Set the number of completed fetches between samples
sample_period = 0x10; // Can be any value > 0x10
sample_type = PERF_SAMPLE_RAW | PERF_SAMPLE_CPU;
disabled = 1;
inherit = 1;
execlude_kernel = 0;
exclude_user = 0;
exclude_hv = 0;
exclude_guest = 0;
exclude_idle = 0;
exclude_host = 0;                    
pinned = 0; 
pecise_ip = 1;
mmap = 1;
comm = 1;
task = 1;
sample_id_all = 1;
comm_exec = 1;
read_format = 0;
mmap_pages= 256; //This can be changed – user settable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few of the fields in these code snippets demand special attention.

1. type
    This identifies the event to be opened. To gather IBS fetch or op events,
    the value in this field must be set to a dynamic value (and thus it can
    change from system to system).
    To gather IBS op samples, the value to set this to can be found in:
    /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_op/type
    To gather IBS fetch samples, the value to set this to can be found in:
    /sys/bus/event_source/devices/ibs_fetch/type.
2. config
    This field should be set according to the type of IBS monitoring
    and the configuration MSR values the user wants.
    For instance, the control MSR for IBS fetch (defined in the AMD BKDG
    or PPR manuals -- MSRC001_1030) says bit 57 will cause the low 4 bits
    of the fetch sample rate to be randomized by hardware. As such, setting
    bit 57 of the config field will enable this feature.
    Details of how this is used can be found in the Linux kernel source at:
    arch/x86/events/amd/ibs.c
3. sample_period
    This field defines how often IBS samples are taken. IBS fetch and op
    sampling is performed differently (as defined in AMD's manuals).
    IBS fetch samples are taken once every sample_period completed fetches.
    In other words, after sample_period fetches successfully send some bytes
    to the decoder, the next fetch is taken as an IBS sample.
    IBS op samples can either count the number of cycles since the last sample,
    or they can be configured (with config bit 19) to count the number of
    ops issued between each sample.
    In either case, this field holds the number of {units} between each IBS
    sample. For both IBS op and fetch sampling, the hardware will ignore
    requests to set the low 4 bits -- as such, the user must set this field
    to at least 0x10.
4. sample_type
    This is normally used to tell perf_events what type of samples to take.
    Since we would like to collect RAW samples from IBS, set this to
    PERF_SAMPLE_RAW | PERF_SAMPLE_CPU.
5. mmap_pages
    This parameter is used to set the size of the kernel ring buffer used to
    hold the IBS samples. This must be a power of two. Setting this to a
    lower values runs the risk of dropping some IBS samples before user-space
    code can read them; increasing it takes more memory space.
6. misc fields
    Currently, the IBS mechanism in Linux's perf_events subsystem does not
    allow exclude_kernel, exclude_host, exclude_guest, exclude_idle, exclude_hv
    or exclude_idle. As such, these should be set to zero.

While it is possible manually invoke the perf_event_open() system call with the
attribute values mentioned above, the Linux perf_events subsystem comes with a
collection of helpful utility functions to do this work as well.
We suggest that a user can utilize perf_evsel__open() and perf_evfunction()
functions. See the Linux source code in tools/perf/util/evsel.{h/c}. These
functions are likely to be easier to use than directly calling
perf_event_open(). They take the same perf_event attribute structures that are
described above. 


How to map the kernel ring buffer in user land to obtain IBS samples
===============================================================================
Once IBS sampling is configured (see above) and enabled (see below), the raw
IBS samples will be collected into a kernel ring buffer (see "mmap_pages" above
for how to set the size of this ring buffer).

To access these samples from a user-land application, this kernel ring buffer
must be mapped to user land. This could be done by mmap()-ing the file
descriptor obtained by perf_event_open.

The first page in the kernel buffer contains metadata. Thus the size of this
mmap() needs to be equal to the size of kernel ring buffer set while opening
the event (the value in the "mmap_pages" field in the attribute) + 1.

However, there are utility functions to make life easier for the purpose as
well. The relevant utility function is perf_evlist__mmap().
(defined in the Linux(r) source code at tools/perf/util/evsel.h/c)


How to start IBS sample collection in perf_events
===============================================================================
With the IBS sampling mechanism configured, and the storage location for the
IBS samples mmap()-ed to allow your user-space application to read it, the next
step is to enable IBS sampling through an ioctl() system call on the IBS file
descriptor (returned from perf_event_open) with the command:
PERF_EVENT_IOC_ENABLE

However, as with other steps, there is a helper function to do this:
perf_evlist__enable().
After IBS sampling is enabled, the application to be monitored can be launched.


Collecting IBS samples out of the perf_events system
===============================================================================
After the IBS sampling mechanism beings creating samples, the user should read
them out of the ring buffer for processing. There are utility functions in
perf to help with this: perf_evlist__mmap_read(). This helper function can be
called in a loop (until it returns NULL) to read the raw samples out of the
ring buffer once at a time. Another utility function,
perf_evlist__mmap_consume(), should be called at the end of each iteration
of this loop to update the head and tail pointers to the kernel ring buffer.

Each call to the perf_evlist__mmap_read() returns an object of a union called
perf_event (defined in the Linux(r) source code: tools/perf/util/event.h).
When no more samples remain perf_evlist__mmap_read() returns NULL.

Each raw perf_event sample can then be parsed using an utility function
called perf_evlist__parse_sample(). This utility function takes a perf_event
object returned by the perf_evlist__mmap_read() and parses it to structure
perf_sample (defined tools/perf/util/event.h).


Parsing raw IBS samples
===============================================================================
The perf_sample data structure will have a "void *raw_data" -- this points
to a region of memory that contains the concatenated values from all of the
IBS registers associated with this sample. Because this is a raw sample, it is
the user's responsibility to parse this series of bytes and make sense of them.

There are two places to look for this information: first, the BKDG or PPR
manuals for your processor will define what the bytes within each register
mean. For example, the PPR for Family 17h Model 01h (available at:
https://support.amd.com/TechDocs/54945_PPR_Family_17h_Models_00h-0Fh.pdf) shows
that bit 58 of MSRC001_1030 is whether this IBS op sample was an L2 cache miss.

The raw_data pointer points to an array of all of the MSRs associated with
this type of IBS sample. The number of registers stored, and the order they are
stored in, depends both on the hardware in use as well as the version of the
Linux(r) kernel in use at the time. The length of the raw_data array is
available in the perf_sample field "raw_size".

The order that these registers are stored depends on the function that stores
the values into the raw_data, which can be found in the Linux IBS source
code. As of Linux 4.11, this is located in the function perf_ibs_handle_irq()
in the file arch/x86/events/amd/ibs.c. You can see each time one of the MSR
values is read into "buf" -- this is the data available in the raw_data array.

For example (all line numbers taken from Linux 4.11 ibs.c):
Both IBS op and fetch samples begin by reading their configuration register
(IBS_FETCH_CTL or IBS_OP_CTL) into the buffer (ibs.c:607).

Then, in a loop at ibs.c:628, most of the remaining registers for this
type of sample are read into the buffer. They are read in numerical order,
starting from the register immediately after the CTL register, through
the last register that all AMD processors that support IBS can use.
The register numbers being iterated through can be found at:
arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h lines 299-310.

Finally, only some AMD processors support the branch target and OPDATA4 MSRs,
so these are only stored out if the CPU supports them.


Disabling IBS sampling
===============================================================================
Once the application is over (or you desire to stop taking IBS samples), the
perf_events IBS sampling can be disabled using an ioctl() system call in a
similar manner to enabling it: use the IOCTL command PERF_EVENT_IOC_DISABLE
The utility function perf_evlist__disable() can be used instead.


A map of AMD Research IBS Toolkit commands to their perf_event mirrors.
===============================================================================
The primary way to interact with the AMD Research IBS Toolkit driver is through
ioctl() commands, which are defined in include/ibs-uapi.h. The AMD driver does
not allow reads with mmap(), but instead allows polling and reading directly
from a file descriptor.

Perhaps most importantly, the AMD Research IBS Toolkit enables IBS on a
per-processor basis (i.e. it is hardware oriented) rather than a per-process
(i.e. software oriented) basis. As such, the file descriptors and ioctl()
operations are associated with a CPU, and any process that runs on that CPU
while IBS is enabled will have samples taken. It is the user's responsibility
to look for samples of interest. The Linux(r) perf_events IBS sampling
mechanism is per-process, and will follow that process as it migrates around
cores.

Because the mechanisms for interacting with these two IBS systems are somewhat
different, this section describes a mapping between the AMD Research IBS
Toolkit calls and the way to perform similar types of commands in the
Linux(r) perf_events subsystem. This should help you port any user-land
software that is initially designed to use the AMD Research IBS Toolkit
to instead use perf_events.
